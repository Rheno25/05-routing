This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Jawaban Soal 1

#### TypeScript
TypeScript is an open-source programming language created by Microsoft that enhances JavaScript by introducing static typing. It seeks to make it easier to create and manage large-scale programs by including type annotations, interfaces, generics, and complex tooling support for code navigation, refactoring, and error detection.

#### ESLint
ESLint is an open-source static code analysis tool that detects and resolves issues in JavaScript and TypeScript code. It assists developers with enforcing coding standards and best practices by inspecting code for potential errors, stylistic issues, and other patterns that could lead to bugs or inconsistencies. ESLint is extremely flexible, allowing developers to adjust rules to their specific project requirements. It works seamlessly with a variety of code editors and build systems, giving developers real-time feedback and enabling a consistent and clean codebase. It is frequently used in modern web development to improve code quality, maintainability, and team cooperation.

#### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the process of creating user interfaces by offering a library of pre-designed utility classes that can be applied directly to HTML elements. Tailwind is different from standard CSS frameworks in that it provides low-level utility classes for basic styles such as margins, padding, typography, and more. This technique provides better flexibility and adaptability, allowing developers to build unique designs without coding new CSS. Tailwind CSS is easy to implement into a variety of web development projects, and its utility-first technique has become more popular due to to its efficiency and scalability in creating flexible and aesthetically beautiful user interfaces.

#### App Router
An app router in a framework generally refers to a component or module that manages navigation and routing within a web or mobile application. It helps in defining the mapping between different views or components and their corresponding URLs, allowing users to easily move across the application's various sections or pages. The app router handles the routing logic, ensuring that the right information is presented based on the user's activities or changes to the URL. It is crucial for structuring and organizing the program, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive user experiences with various views or pages. The examples for this are frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue.

#### Import Alias
An import alias in a framework is a technique that allows developers to provide alternate names for imported modules or components in their codebase. This feature makes import statements clearer and more concise, especially when dealing with long or nested file paths. By providing an alias to a module or component, developers can refer to it with a shorter and more descriptive name, which improves code readability and maintenance. Import aliases are widely used in modern JavaScript frameworks such as TypeScript, Vue.js, and React, where developers can set up aliases in their build tools or module bundlers to simplify the import process and organize codebases.

#### .git
The .git folder is a hidden directory that is created when you initialize a new Git repository in a directory. It's the heart of a Git repository and contains all the necessary metadata and object database for the repository.

#### node_modules
The node_modules directory is a popular location in Node.js projects. It stores any third-party dependencies required by a Node.js application or module. Node.js package managers such as npm (Node Package Manager) and yarn automatically install dependencies in the node_modules subdirectory.

#### public
In Node.js web applications, the public folder is usually used for storing static assets such as HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, pictures, fonts, and other files that the web server serves directly to the client.

#### src
In Node.js applications, the src (short for "source") folder is usually used to store the application's source code. It is where developers often store the files providing the logic, functionality, and modules that comprise the program.

#### .eslintsrc.json
The .eslintrc.json file is used in Node.js projects to configure the ESLint part of the project.

#### .gitignore
The.gitignore file specifies which untracked files Git should ignore. These files are usually generated as byproducts of the development process, temporary files, compiled code, or sensitive information that should not be committed to the Git repository.

#### next.config.mjs
The next.config.mjs file in a Next.js project is used to configure settings and adjust the framework's behavior. It enables developers to alter default configurations and add new features to their Next.js applications.

The.mjs file extension indicates that the configuration file was written using the ECMAScript Modules syntax.

#### next-env.d.ts
The next-env.d.ts file in a Next.js project defines types for the Next.js application environment when TypeScript is used. This file helps TypeScript in understanding and type-checking particular Next.js features and environment parameters.

#### package.json
The package.json file in a Node.js project is a central configuration file that provides metadata about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and other critical information. This file is critical for maintaining Node.js applications because it identifies the project's dependencies, which are external libraries and modules that the application requires to run properly. The package.json file also allows you to write custom scripts for things like running tests, creating the application, and starting the development server. Furthermore, it enables developers to enter metadata such as the project's creator, license, and repository URL, facilitating the sharing and collaboration of Node.js projects. 

#### package-lock.json
The 'package-lock.json' file in a Node.js project is used to restrict the specific versions of dependencies installed in the project's 'node_modules' directory. It serves as a deterministic record of the exact dependency tree created by the package manager (such as npm or Yarn) during installation. This file assures that corresponding installations of the project on different environments or by different developers produce the exact same dependency tree, preventing unexpected changes or inconsistencies. The 'package-lock.json' file contributes to consistency and reproducibility across various development and deployment environments, ensuring that the project works consistently no matter where it is installed.

#### postcss.config.js
The postcss.config.js file in a Node.js project is used to configure PostCSS, a tool for converting CSS using JavaScript plugins. This configuration file allows developers to select the PostCSS plugins, settings, and options to use while processing CSS files. It acts as an interface for defining PostCSS changes like autoprefixing, CSS minification, and support for future CSS syntax improvements.

#### tailwind.config.ts
The tailwind.config.ts file is used in Node.js projects that use the Tailwind CSS framework. This configuration file enables developers to modify and develop Tailwind CSS's default settings, such as color palettes, typography, spacing, and more. Developers can adjust Tailwind CSS to their project's design requirements and aesthetic preferences by setting custom configurations in the tailwind.config.ts file. This file also enables advanced functionality like removing unused CSS classes, minimizing build sizes, and customizing plugins or third-party integrations.

#### tsconfig.json
The 'tsconfig.json' file in a Node.js project is used to set up TypeScript compiler settings and options. It defines how TypeScript should compile TypeScript files (.ts) into JavaScript files (.js) and other compiler parameters such as target ECMAScript version, module system (CommonJS, ES Modules), source map creation, strict type-checking rules, and so on. This configuration file allows developers to customize the TypeScript compiler's behavior to their project's specific requirements and standards.
